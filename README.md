Excuser is a Google Chrome extension designed to generate random excuses to help users get out of various situations. The extension provides a popup interface with different categories of excuses, such as "Unbelievable", "Funny", "College", and "Developers".


The user interface is built with HTML and CSS, and it uses Bootstrap for styling. The extension fetches excuses from an external API hosted at https://excuser-three.vercel.app/
